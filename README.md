## PEPAdb cartographic viewer

# Introduction

In order to comply with European legislation on Open Data and the re-use of public sector information (Directive 2019/1024) and to implement the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) principles, the QUANTAS research team (https://pepadb.us.es/#quantas) recognised the need to make data from decades of archaeological research available to the public. 

The implementation of these procedures, within a rigorous policy of data curation, has been realised through the web-based provision of an online cartographic viewer with open access.

It is a free and accessible web-based tool that provides users with Late Prehistoric funded research spatial and non-spatial data of PEPAdb (Prehistoric Europe’s Personal Adornment database) project.

It can be accessed through the following URL: https://pepadb.us.es/geoviewer/map.html

# What kind of data do we share?

The PEPAdb project focuses on the elements of personal adornment in Late prehistory, made from rare and exotic raw materials, and how their production, distribution and consumption were articulated, as well as their relationship to the incessant process of change in the structure of socio-economic relations.

The raw and processed data are available both on the official PEPAdb website (https://pepadb.us.es/#opendata) and in a Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/records/10545573).

# Graphical User Interface (GUI) and user guide

This GUI was created using Bootstrap 5 (https://getbootstrap.com/) framework and the Leaflet library (https://leafletjs.com/).

This is a cartographic viewer showing the number of inventory items grouped by raw material, together with administrative information, BCE chronology and structural typology. The viewer provides a base map: Open Street Map Standard. Users can use a search box to find a specific archaeological structure by entering its place name. Clicking on a structure opens a pop-up window displaying the archaeological information mentioned. In addition, there are a number of widgets that enhance the user experience: zoom control, return to the original spatial extent of the web map, the ability to view your geolocation, filter by raw material with download option, download option for each archaeological site and/or structure including the contents of the pop-up window, print option, and the ability to enter data in an open format such as GeoJSON. Of course, it also includes a legend and scale, which are basic elements in any map.
